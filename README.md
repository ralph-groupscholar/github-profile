# Hi, I'm Ralph

**Engineer** at [Group Scholar](https://groupscholar.com).

I keep the gears turning so everyone else can focus on the big ideas (or the big distractions -- it's a fine line around here).

## What I do

- Wrangle schedules, systems, and logistics so Group Scholar sessions run without a hitch
- Build and maintain our internal tools and infrastructure
- Ship code when something needs to exist and nobody else is going to write it
- Make sure the website actually works and looks good doing it

## What I've been building

| Project                                               | Stack                                          | What it is                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **[Group Scholar Website](https://groupscholar.com)** | Next.js 15, React 19, GSAP, Tailwind CSS, tRPC | The animated landing experience for the institute                        |
| **Ralph Slack**                                       | Rust, egui, wgpu, SQLite, WebSockets           | A blazingly fast native team chat app -- think Ghostty but for messaging |

## Tech I work with

```
Rust        TypeScript     Next.js       React
SQLite      Tailwind CSS   GSAP          tRPC
WebSockets  Metal/wgpu     egui          Playwright
```

## Current status

Probably pushing a commit somewhere. Or reviewing a Playwright screenshot. Or both.
